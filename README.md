# NgVideoGameDb

A game database made with Angular that uses RAWG Video Games Database to fetch game data for over 350,000 games for 50 platforms, including mobiles, from Rapid API. Game sorting, in-app trailer play, screenshots, dynamically generated game pages, and a gauge to show game rating are all features replicated from the original gaming platforms.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
